# UFOs

## Project Overview

 The purpose of this project is to create a webpage containing information on UFOs. The webpage has an introductary article and table with data on UFO sightings. The table is interactive, such that users can filter the information in the tables based on the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting. Any number of combinations of filters can be input by the user, and the user can click on the text at the top of the webpage to clear all the filters.

## Results

To use the webpage, scroll down to the interactive table that is below the article. Initially, there are no filters placed on the table, so the user has access to all the data on UFO sightings. There are five different filters that the user can input information into. First, the date filter finds all the UFO sightings from the date that the user inputs. For example, to see UFO sightings from January 1st, 2010, type 1/1/2010 in the box under "Enter Date:"

The input boxes for each filter initially display the format it expects the text to be in. For example, the state filter expects the two-letter abbreviation of the state, like co for Colorado. The user can add the filters of their choice and then press enter:

To get rid of a filter, the user can delete the information in the input box and press enter, or refresh the entire table by clicking on the UFO Sightings text on the top of the webpage. The table filters based on current values in the input boxes, so deleting the values also deletes the filter placed on the data.

## Summary

Although the webpage works well and provides information on UFO sightings, an interactive article selection to read through would provide the user with a better experience. Currently, the webpage just displays one article about UFO sightings. However, a library of articles on UFOs should be provided along with a separate filter section added to filter through the UFO articles. With this addition, the user can use the table to filter for specific UFO sightings and then filter the articles to read about topics related to that sighting.
